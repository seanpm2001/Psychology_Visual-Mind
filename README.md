## Visual Mind

### General

My mind can play videos, images, and audio in the background while I do other things. I have a highly visual mind that most people don't have. However, I don't have perfect memory, and can't pinpoint every event to a single date mentally.

### Videos

I can play and edit videos within my mind, the playback and editing is done automatically, with very little control by me on playback, and rare control on editing (which I can only do in my sleep)

#### DreamScene

DreamScene is the codename I gave to the part of my mind that allows me to force lucid dreams, and edit my dreams as they happen. This can be performed only in sleep levels below 75%, most notably in half sleep. I usually only launch DreamScene when I have difficulty falling asleep, as once sleep levels hit 75%, I fall asleep quickly. I can control a scenario, like it is a video game, and I can even die in my dreams, and keep sleeping. Death in my dreams results in severe cognitive load if I am aiming to revive my character, but requires little cognitive load if I am to switch to another character (or the POV camera)

### Images

[:octocat: See also: Character images](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Character_Image_Research/)

I can see images in my head other than what is being presented in front of me.

### Audio

Like most people, I can play audio in my head, and suffer from earworms. I don't consider this to be that unique.
